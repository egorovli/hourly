# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be kind. Be respectful. No toxicity.

## Expected Behavior

- Treat everyone with respect and consideration
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community and the project
- Show empathy toward others

## Zero Tolerance

The following will result in an **immediate and permanent ban**:

- **Slurs** of any kind
- **Hate speech** — racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any form of discrimination
- **Harassment** — personal attacks, intimidation, stalking, unwelcome sexual attention
- **Toxicity** — trolling, insults, deliberately inflammatory behavior

No warnings. No second chances. This applies everywhere: issues, pull requests, discussions, commits, and any other project spaces.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Beyond zero-tolerance violations, don't:

- Dismiss or belittle others' contributions
- Derail discussions with off-topic arguments
- Share others' private information without consent
- Engage in bad faith arguments

## Enforcement

Violations are reviewed by project maintainers. For zero-tolerance violations, action is immediate.

**Report violations to:** [anton@egorov.io](mailto:anton@egorov.io)

Reports are handled confidentially. Include as much context as possible: links, screenshots, timestamps.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and when representing the project publicly.

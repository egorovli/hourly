# Automates releases using conventional commits via release-please.
# - On pushes to main: creates/updates a release PR with changelog
# - When release PR merges: creates a GitHub release and tags
# See: https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action
#
# IMPORTANT: Events created with GITHUB_TOKEN don't trigger other workflows.
# This workflow uses workflow_call to explicitly trigger the Build workflow
# after a release is created, ensuring Docker images are built with semver tags.
